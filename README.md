# Contolling-PC-with-Hand-Gestures
The hand gestures in front of the Ultrasonic sensors can be calibrated so that they can perform five different tasks on your computer. Before taking a look at the gestures, let us first see the tasks that we can accomplish.

Gesture 1: Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand away from the sensor. This gesture will Scroll Down the Web Page or Decrease the Volume.

Gesture 2: Place your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor at a distance (between 15CM to 35CM) for a small duration and move your hand towards the sensor. This gesture will Scroll up the Web Page or Increase the Volume.

Gesture 3: Swipe your hand in front of the Right Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Next Tab.

Gesture 4: Swipe your hand in front of the Left Ultrasonic Sensor. This gesture will move to the Previous Tab or Play/Pause the Video.

Gesture 5: Swipe your hand across both the sensors (Left Sensor first). This action will Switch between Tasks.

Application of Arduino based Hand Gesture Control of Computer

    In this project, we have implemented Arduino based Hand Gesture Control of Your Computer, where few hand gestures made in front of the computer will perform certain tasks in the computer without using mouse or keyboard.
    Such Gesture based Control of Computers is already present and a company called Leap Motion has been implementing such technology in computers.
    This type of hand gesture control of computers can be used for VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality), 3D Design, Reading Sign Language, etc.
